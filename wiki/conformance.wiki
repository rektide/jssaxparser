= Conformance =

Several test suites demonstrate the conformance of that parser with w3c XML specifications.

== Comparison with Firefox native DOM parser ==

The test page "tests/sax_tests.html" takes several test files from "test_files/" and parses them with Firefox DOM parser. It then compares the DOM tree result of both parsing. It shows that results are identical. Jssaxparser is even more conform, so we had to add some features to the parser in order to be less strict.


== W3C test suite ==

Jssaxparser has a reasonable score of 223 success over 364 test cases at the drastic James Clark XML test suite. The test page can be seen in "tests/w3c_test_james_clark.html".
The other tests suites are under analysis.


== Performance ==

There is a real challenge to preserve conformance against performance. A "light" version of jssaxparser, without DTD validation, less respecting UTF characters conventions and serialization concerns, will be released.
